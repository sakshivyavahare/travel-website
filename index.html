          <h3>India</h3>
          <p>It was my first trip to India; I had no idea about the place and was little worried as I was travelling alone but much to my surprise, Culture Holidays india , the company I book for my tours, made this trip of mine, memorable and beautiful. I visited India or to be pr√©cised South India, Kerala on early December 2011 and had efficiently made all the required arrangements from Malaysia, only.ruly, booking Culture Holidays for my South India Trip was my best decision, as the minute I landed to Mumbai and then to Cochin,
            I must tell you, Kerala is a beautiful place to explore and with Culture Holidays, it became best tour of my life. Most difficulties which foreigners face in India is to communicate with an Indian driver but my driver was really speaking good English. Soon, I along with my guide went for some sightseeing in Cochin. First place, I visited was Marine Drive and then I went to enjoy some other popular destinations like Chinese Fishing Nets, Mattancherry Dutch Palace and Portuguese Churches.
